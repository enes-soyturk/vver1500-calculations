# vver1500-calculations
**Information Section:
**
During my studies at the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), I completed a course project focused on the VVER-1500 nuclear reactor.
This document includes technical calculations related to:

Reactor structure and operational principles

Thermal efficiency and power output

Coolant, cladding, and fuel temperatures along the reactor core height

Safety margin (DNBR) analysis

Pressure drop across the reactor core

The work involved detailed thermodynamic and thermal-hydraulic calculations based on data available for the VVER-1500 design.
Sources used include technical references and open literature.
This project helped me strengthen my knowledge in nuclear reactor thermal analysis, system efficiency evaluation, and safety calculations.
