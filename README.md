🌐 VVER-1500 Reactor Thermal Analysis Project

📌 Project Overview

This repository showcases a course project focused on the VVER-1500 nuclear reactor, completed during my studies at the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute).

The project involves detailed technical calculations related to:

Reactor structure and operational principles

Thermal efficiency and power output

Temperature distribution of coolant, cladding, and fuel along the reactor core height

Safety margin (DNBR) analysis

Pressure drop across the reactor core

The calculations are grounded in available design data for the VVER-1500 reactor, supported by extensive thermodynamic and thermal-hydraulic analysis.

🎯 Purpose

This project strengthened my expertise in:

Nuclear reactor thermal analysis

System efficiency evaluation

Safety calculations and core design parameters

📚 References

Data and background information were sourced from technical references and publicly available literature.
