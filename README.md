# VVER-1500 Reactor Thermal Analysis Project

## Overview

During my studies at the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), I completed a course project focused on the VVER-1500 nuclear reactor.

This project includes detailed technical calculations related to:

- Reactor structure and operational principles
- Thermal efficiency and power output
- Coolant, cladding, and fuel temperature distribution along the reactor core height
- Safety margin (DNBR) analysis
- Pressure drop across the reactor core

The calculations are based on available design data for the VVER-1500 reactor and involved extensive thermodynamic and thermal-hydraulic analysis.

## Purpose

This project strengthened my expertise in:

- Nuclear reactor thermal analysis
- System efficiency evaluation
- Safety calculations and core design parameters

## References

Data and background information were obtained from technical references and publicly available literature.
